# How to use

First, run 

    git clone https://github.com/xamyl/playaudiobot/playaudiobot.git
    cd playaudiobot

then, Replace audio.mp3 with your own mp3. Or if you want to listen to hampsterdance then don't i guess

Edit your .env file from

   TOKEN=REPLACE_ME

to your token.

To get a token, go to https://discord.com/developers/applications

Click "New Application"

Name it something

Click "Bot" 

Click "Reset Token"

Click "Copy"

It will look something like this: MTMxMjUwNDQ5NDQwMzIyMzY4NA.GchDaY.YwTInPvsKuDTfJiKLz3Bg9Vj5cpQoqMMfnl4co (Obviously not an actual token, keep your real token secure!)

Replace the "REPLACE_ME" text with that copied token.

It will look like 

    TOKEN=MTMxMjUwNDQ5NDQwMzIyMzY4NA.GchDaY.YwTInPvsKuDTfJiKLz3Bg9Vj5cpQoqMMfnl4co

Now, run 

    node index.js


Run /join and it will work!
